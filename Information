How to Use
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The web interface runs on Python 3, using Flask to handle the server side.
In order to run the interface:
    * open up the Terminal and cd into the top layer of the code directory
    * Call the command 'python3 app.py'. This runs the main controller file that
      Flask uses to get the server up and running.
    * Open your browser and visit 'http://0.0.0.0:8080/' to interact with the
      interface




To-Do
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Pause & Stop buttons on interface need to work with playback on Pi
-Timing scroll bar on playback page needs to start at 0:00 and:
    * Continuously update while song is playing
    * Move playback to chosen point on scroll bar when it is moved
-Different channels (tracks) need to be enabled/disabled when checkboxes are
 checked/unchecked
-Tempo of song playback needs to be changed depending on entered value

-UI needs to be cleaned up (optional)
